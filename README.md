The cannon (cannon cannon cannon) is an on chain interactive dispute engine implementing EVM-equivalent fault proofs.

It's half geth, half MIPS, and whole awesome.

* It's Go code
* ...that runs an EVM
* ...emulating a MIPS machine
* ...running compiled Go code
* ...that runs an EVM

For more information on Cannon's inner workings, check [this overview][overview].

## Directory Layout

```
minigeth -- A standalone "geth" capable of computing a block transition
mipigo -- minigeth compiled for MIPS. Outputs a MIPS binary that's run and mapped at 0x0
mipsevm -- A MIPS runtime in the EVM (works with contracts)
contracts -- A Merkleized MIPS processor on chain + the challenge logic
```

## Building

Pre-requisites: Go, Node.js, Make, and CMake.

```
make build
make test # verify everything works correctly
```

## Examples

The script files [`demo/challenge_simple.sh`](demo/challenge_simple.sh) and
[`demo/challenge_fault.sh`](demo/challenge_fault.sh) present two example scenarios demonstrating the
whole process of a fault proof, including the challenge game and single step verification.

- In the `simple` challenge, the challenger uses the wrong block data in his challenge.
- In the `fault` scenario, fault injection is used to alter the challenger's memory at a specific
  step of the execution.

In both cases, the challenger fails to challenge the block. Refer to the documentation string at the
top of these files for more details regarding the scenario.

## State Oracle API

On chain / in MIPS, we have two simple oracles

* InputHash() -> hash
* Preimage(hash) -> value

We generate the Preimages in x86 using geth RPC

* PrefetchAccount
* PrefetchStorage
* PrefetchCode
* PrefetchBlock

These are NOP in the VM
